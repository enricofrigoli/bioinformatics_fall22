# Project: Antibody Sequence Analysis


## Task 1 - Sequence Logos from Multiple Sequence Alignment

* Create a multiple sequence alignment of the antibody sequences
* Visualize the multiple sequence alignemnt using a sequence logo
* (optional) Create the alignemnts using hidden markow models (see [ANARCI](https://github.com/oxpig/ANARCI))

## Task 2 - Humanization model

* Given an input sequence, perform pairwise alignment to each sequence in the datasets
* Identify sequence in the database with highest alignment score. Try also to find heavy chain sequences of therapeuti antibodies - Muromonab, Bevacizumab, Caplacizumab
* (optional) Highlight the positions in yout query sequence that are not well aligning to human sequences and comment about them being potential target positions for engineering
* (optional) Recreate the results of the LSTM classifier of human/mouse sequences, link [here](https://github.com/vkola-lab/peds2019)
